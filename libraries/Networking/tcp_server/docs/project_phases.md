# Project Phases

## Overview

### Phase 1: Planning and Setup

1. **Define Requirements**
   - Specify functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Define performance metrics (e.g., maximum number of concurrent connections).

2. **Research and Study**
   - Study relevant materials (books, tutorials, articles) on TCP servers, `poll()`, and threading.
   - Review existing open-source projects for insights and best practices.

3. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Install necessary tools and libraries (e.g., compiler, debugger).
   - Set up a version control system (e.g., Git).

### Phase 2: Core Development Tasks

1. **Socket Programming Basics**
   - Create a basic server socket.
   - Implement connection handling (accepting connections).

2. **Implement `poll()` Mechanism**
   - Integrate `poll()` to monitor multiple sockets.
   - Handle different socket events (new connections, data reception).

3. **Thread Pool Implementation**
   - Design and implement a thread pool architecture.
   - Create task queues and synchronize access to shared resources.

### Phase 3: Feature Development

1. **Connection Management**
   - Implement mechanisms to track and manage multiple client connections.
   - Handle client disconnections and timeouts.

2. **Data Handling**
   - Implement data receiving and sending functionalities.
   - Ensure efficient and safe data handling between threads.

3. **Request Processing**
   - Develop functions to process different types of client requests.
   - Structure the logic for responses based on request type.

### Phase 4: Testing and Optimization

1. **Unit Testing**
    - Write tests for individual modules (socket handling, `poll()` logic, thread pool).
    - Use tools like Valgrind to check for memory leaks and other issues.

2. **Integration Testing**
    - Test the server with simulated client interactions.
    - Ensure all components work together as expected.

3. **Performance Tuning**
    - Profile the server to identify bottlenecks.
    - Optimize code for better performance (e.g., optimizing `poll()` usage, improving thread management).

### Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance

1. **Deployment**
    - Prepare the server for deployment (configuration, security settings).
    - Deploy the server in a testing or production environment.

2. **Documentation**
    - Document the serverâ€™s architecture, setup, and usage guidelines.
    - Ensure code is well-documented for future maintenance.

3. **Maintenance Plan**
    - Establish a process for updating and maintaining the server.
    - Plan for handling server downtime and logging errors.

### Phase 6: Evaluation and Iteration

1. **Feedback Collection**
    - Gather user feedback or logs to evaluate server performance and usability.
    - Identify areas for improvement or additional features.

2. **Iterative Improvements**
    - Implement new features or improvements based on feedback and testing.
    - Continuously refine performance and usability.

This task breakdown not only structures your project into logical steps but also ensures that each phase builds upon the work completed in the previous steps, leading to a systematic and comprehensive development process.
